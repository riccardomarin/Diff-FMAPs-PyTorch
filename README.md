## Correspondence Learning via Linearly-invariant Embedding (PyTorch)

This repository is a PyTorch implementation of [Correspondence Learning via Linearly-invariant Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13136).

This is *not* the code used to produce the paper results, which can be found [Here](https://github.com/riccardomarin/Diff-FMaps).
This implementation has been made to make handier the use of the method (and also to replicate it).

### Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Installing PyTorch may require an ad hoc procedure, depending on your computer settings.

### Data & Pretrained models
You can download data and the pre-trained models using the scripts:
```
python .\data\download_data.py
python .\models\pretrained\download_pretrained.py
```

### Training

To train the basis and descriptors models, run these commands:

```train
python .\code\train_basis.py
python .\code\train_desc.py
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model on FAUST w\noise, run:

```eval
python .\code\test_faust.py
```
And in matlab the script:
```eval
.\evaluation\evaluation.m
```
### Results

These are the results of the two implementations:

| Model name         | Ours            | Ours+Opt       |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| TF 1.5             |     6.0e-2      |      2.9e-2    |
| PyTorch            |     5.7e-2      |      3.1e-2    |

The small discrepancies have several reasons:
1) basis and descriptors networks are trained 400 epochs in PyTorch implementation; several thousand in TF 1.5
2) while the two implementations are similar, there are some differences in the training process and hyperparameters due to libraries.
3) the training requires pseudo-inverse computation; these can produce different results depending on the library
